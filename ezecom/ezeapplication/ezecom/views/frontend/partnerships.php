						<h2>EzeCampus</h2>
						<p>
							EzeCampus is the name we have given to EZECOM’s support to education in Cambodia. 
							In June of 2010 the first step in the EzeCampus program was announced. 
							In cooperation with the Ministry of Education, EZECOM installed fibre optic 
							connection in the top universities of Phnom Penh, giving the students at their 
							university access to high speed internet.

							<h3>The first step in the EzeCampus gave 65,000 students access to high speed internet.</h3>
							<p>
								In August 2012, we announced the second phase of the EzeCampus project. 
								We provided internet service and computer equipment to 50 public secondary 
								education schools and teacher training institutions in the country. 
								With this agreement, EZECOM was able to provide broader educational 
								resources to classes in various provinces countrywide. It also means that 
								distance learning may become a reality for hundreds of thousands of students 
								nationwide in the near future. The donation in the form of free Internet service 
								and network instalments is worth tens of thousands of US dollars.

							<h3>The second step expanded the number of students benefiting from this project by another ten thousand.</h3>
							<p>
								Regarding the project, Paul Blanche-Horgan, CEO of EZECOM, said, 
								“EZECOM always wishes to use its IT capacity to contribute to the country’s 
								development. This plan will allow us to use our 9,000-kilometer optical cable 
								network to provide educational opportunities to youth across the country.” 
								Among all our corporate social responsibility projects, education takes a 
								special place and we are always looking for ways to contribute to Cambodia’s development.
